Build production-ready, comprehensive components and all other code files - not minimal stubs
Add to and improve existing implementations - don't replace them
Each component should be modular, reusable, and fully functional
No placeholders, no "TODO" comments, no incomplete implementations
always have a changelod.md file created and update it regularly
never use packages and dependencies that are deprecated, or unsupported
never use implicit any types, unresolved any or nulls, no unused imports, declared and unused vars
when you find unused vars, make sure to fully implement them as they are there because we knew they would be needed.
when you encounter a persistent erro or issue, do not give up, "try a simpler way..." or any other means of avoiding actually having to solve the issue. follow the following steps: identify what the issue/error really is, review relevant docs, create a step by step plan, execute fix
